# DBViewer 2.0

The current NISP viewer is a high specialized and complexed piece of
software, which does not scale very well and is extreemly difficult to
extend. So DBviewer 2.0 will therefore be a very different piece of
software, which can either be seen as a replacement or a new piece of
software supporting the IP CaT.

# Goals

* Implement as Web application
* Use webstandards: HTML5, CSS3 and ECMAScript 5 (or potentially as ECMA Script 6)
* Use responsive design
* Mobile first
* Use MVC framework for frontend
* Use platform independent REST interface between frontend and backend
* Backend ?
* Implement DB Viewer functionality
* Support for IE8? Properly not!
* Create profiles?
